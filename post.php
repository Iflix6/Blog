                        I’ve been a freelancer for many years, and I have had some big successes along the way. Having to work online can be fun when the necessary conditions are in-tune to what you want or need and sometimes it leaves you depressed when expected results are not met.
                        Still, none of my earlier successes compare to the first day I made $100 on the internet within a 24-hour period. Something about getting $100 from creating a gig for a particular client, made me feel mind-blown and really ecstatic about what the future held for me.
                        It really changed the way I got serious about earning money online from the comfort of my home.
